#### [1] Graph Based Over-Segmentation Methods for 3D Point Clouds
Over-segmentation, or super-pixel generation, is a common preliminary stage for many computer vi-sion applications.

 Over-segmentation can be considered as a compact and in-formative description of the scene, using a substantially lower number of elements than the initial pixel repre-sentation. It signi cantly reduces the amount of data that must be dealt with for the following image analy-sis stages, without loss of information.

Super-pixels were shown to be very useful as inputs for higher-level vision tasks such as se-mantic segmentation (Gould et al, 2008; Farabet et al, 2013), scene classi cation (Juneja et al, 2013), 3D ge-ometry inference (Hoiem, 2007), and tracking (Oron et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2011). 

The data can be subdivided by a 3D regular grid, but data-driven subdivision that relies on 3D properties might be much more e ective.
